# Warsaw_heatwaves
Simple analysis of frequency of heatwaves in Warsaw. I used data for Warsaw from IMGW to compare the number of hot days in periods 1989-2004 and 2004-2018 selecting various conditions that would make day count a day as a hot day or part of a heatwave. I checked how much the observed increase is depending on the choice of these conditions.
